We need a few different things to make a game. This area will serve as our collaborative space to share ideas and draw inspiration from. It'll serve as the outline for what we are building.

See [Tools](Tools/Tools.md) for quick set-up with the tools we will be using for the project

See [Assets](Assets/Assets.md) for details about art direction

See [World](World/World.md) for writings about the lore and motivations of our players/enemies/actors

See [Design](Design/Design.md) for information about how the game should look/feel as a person playing it
