//Summoners rift is a map with three lanes

//Players should be able to traverse the map, as they reach the edge of the screen, the map should scroll to reveal more of the map

// See ../assets/maps/summoner_rift.png for the map image

//This file will contain any static data related to the Summoner's Rift map, such as spawn points, terrain features, etc.

//I'll continue to add examples of what could go in here while we wait for real art and level design
