//TODO

// Railgun ability 1 - ninja star attack, fast moving projectile that does moderate damage with distance falloff

// Should probably have a longer interval than the magic missle, but be more powerful


// Railgun ability 2 - long range beam that pierces (doesn't stop when it makes contact with collider)
// Width and damage have a set maximum, that builds up over time while charging between shots

// For example, if the player shoots immediately after the cooldown, the beam is thin and low damage

// But if the player waits a few seconds, the beam becomes wider and more powerful

// Holding down ability 1 button after expending the charge should lock the player's movement, and gradually restore charge
