// TODO Base class for area boundaries to be used in maps

// The files in the maps folder will extend this class to create boundaries for different areas in the game. 
// These boundaries will prevent players from leaving the playable area and can also be used to trigger events when players enter or exit certain zones

// However, this can also be extended for other uses such as hazards or special zones that affect player movement or health (like lava, mud, or healing zones).
