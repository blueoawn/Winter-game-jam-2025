# Stuff that would be great ASAP
## Characters / Enemies
* Character portrait
	- Thumbnail used for picking the character, dialog boxes, menus ect
* In game sprite
	- minimum 3 each character for isometric
	- add a couple for special abilities 
	- item interaction

## Interactable
- items you pick up, coins, power-ups, objectives ect
	- Probably don't need many different viewpoints (spawn in the same) but more animated so the player can easily distinguish them
		- 6 - 24 animation frames

## Walls / Static objects
- Stuff that is in the way of the player, restricting their movement in some capacity


# Stuff we can work on a little later

## Backdrops
- Stuff we can use for our levels, boss areas, where enemies spawn ect
## Particles
* When shit gets blown up
* when power ups are obtained
* Objective scored
* item consumed
* ect
## User interface and menu items
- Stuff that's still apart of the game, but isn't directly apart of it
- We can go crazy with this if we want (Persona?) or just keep it simple
